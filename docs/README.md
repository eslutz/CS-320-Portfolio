## Reflection

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

By thorough testing of any code, program, or software it can help ensure that it is functional and secure.  Testing early and often allows you to find issues with the code sooner, which means you can make corrections or improvements sooner.  By making sure the code functions as expected and can handle edge cases means the software is more secure and less likely to fail.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs can be translated into requirements for the program.  Those requirements can then be used to create the different components of the program.  Additionally, the requirements can then be used as criteria during testing to confirm that all of the requirements have been met.

### How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software starts with gathering and understanding the requirements.  From there, depending on the number of requirements, I break it down into smaller, related, groups of tasks.  Then I get to work writing the code.  It is best to be sure to create unit tests as youâ€™re going to make sure the parts of the program are working as expected.
